Update the project with the following new changes and ultra-modern upgrades:

- Use extremely high-weight, modern, professional fonts across the entire website. Apply the two selected fonts to all headings, subheadings, and body text — this must be controlled from the config file.

- Improve the full landing page design:
  - Every section must be ultra high-end, premium, professional.
  - Fullscreen height for the hero section (one scroll view).
  - Left side: heading, sub text. Right side: Discord illustration/image.
  - No colored button backgrounds in the hero — follow same theme color as other sections.
  - Apply proper font sizing, spacing, responsiveness, and weight.
  - Make the hero section far more modern and appealing with ultra clean layout and animation.

- Update the header:
  - Add icons before each dropdown subcategory item (e.g., Discord bot, Telegram bot, Minecraft).
  - Add icons before dropdown items in Client Area as well.
  - Dropdown boxes should be larger, modern, smooth animated, and fully responsive.
  - Portix Host text + logo image must be placed far left of the header.
  - Client Area button must be far right (highlighted with bg #0195f4).
  - Entire header should be advanced, clean, and sticky.

- Section Tags:
  - Before each section heading, add a label/tag with a relevant phrase (like “We Won’t Disappoint” for features), with a small star or icon above the heading.
  - Make these tags dynamic and editable from the config.

- Redesign the “What We Provide” section:
  - Section background: #0F1014.
  - Use modern grid cards with bold fonts, icons, and hover effects.
  - Each card must be ultra modern, more spacious, and readable across devices.

- Section background colors:
  - Hero Section: #060201
  - Our Features: #060201
  - Why Portix Host: #0F1014

- Improve “Why Portix Host?” section:
  - Use image alongside the text (e.g., server or enterprise-grade infrastructure illustration).
  - Box layout with powerful text: “Enterprise-grade infrastructure trusted by developers worldwide.”
  - Design must be ultra clean and high quality.

- Replace the Discord Bot Hosting Plans section with:
  - “What Our Customers Say” section with:
    - Rotating customer testimonials (slider or auto-rotate).
    - Stars showing their ratings.
    - Switch arrows to manually change testimonials.
    - “Read more reviews on Trustpilot” button.
    - Fully modern, icon-based, bold, and professional layout.

- Make the FAQ section ultra modern:
  - Use advanced accordion styles with smooth transitions.
  - Add support for images or icons within answers (editable from config).
  - More spacing, better layout, and animation.

- Rebuild the footer:
  - Use category columns like Services, Learn, Legal, Connect.
  - Use icons for each footer link (where relevant).
  - Ultra clean layout, spacing, and responsive.
  - Add copyright.

- **All page content and design must be fully dynamic** via the config file:
  - All hero headings, subtexts, images.
  - Section titles, tags, texts.
  - All plan data, names, prices, specs.
  - All nav items, dropdown items, links, and icons.
  - Fonts, font sizes, font families.
  - Testimonials, team members, FAQs, blog/docs articles.
  - Option to add/remove any card, item, testimonial, team member, etc.

- Complete the missing pages:
  - Web Hosting → create two subpages: WordPress Hosting and Shared Hosting
  - FAQ page → fully dynamic FAQs from config
  - About Us page → include team member section (default 1 box with PFP, name, title, detailed role/description — future members can be added via config)
  - Blog page → designed like detailed documentation/tutorials for setting up services (e.g., using Pterodactyl for NodeJS/Python bots or web hosting). Must be ultra detailed and editable via config like a docs system.

- Remove the "Support" navigation item from header completely.

- Make the entire website:
  - Highly icon-enhanced in relevant places.
  - Responsive across all screens.
  - Font-configurable (all fonts used across the site should be changeable via config).
  - Image-configurable (hero image, team PFPs, etc.).
  - Hosting links, subcategories, and text — all should be fully dynamic via config.

Apply all changes and rebuild the project using these exact specifications.
